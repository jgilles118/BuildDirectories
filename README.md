# Creating Directories/Folders using Java

This java code was created to teach students how to build directories or folders in a Windows OS.

This code will work for other operating systems,
but the student must remember to change the path 
and follow the path sequence of the OS being used.

Follow the comments and make any adjustment to the statements.
